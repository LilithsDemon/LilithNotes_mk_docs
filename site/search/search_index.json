Safety of data in terms of compliance with the law (e.g. GDPR) Data integrity is important to ensure your database is efficient, preventing redundant and inaccurate data, and stopping it from being lost. Ensuring data integrity is vital to a business, as loss of data can cause huge fines from GDPR and reputational risks (i.e. customers won't use your bank if you cannot keep your data secure) Entity integrity This ensures rows are not using repeated data, and that the primary keys ensures each row is individually accessible. (Can use data types/lengths for this) This ensures that each entity is also individually accessible Referential integrity Ensures that the values between relationships are accurate (i.e. PK and FK match up), using methods like CASCADE Domain integrity Ensures that each column of the entity is valid, and does not contain any duplicates or any unnecessary data. user-defined integrity Ensuring that users do not implement invalid and incorrect data This is usually done through validation and sanitation on a website or program. Data validation Data validation prevents invalid or incorrect data from being inputted to the database. This can be done through setting data types and limiting the length of the inputted value, (i.e. for a phone number, you could set it to int only and limit it to 11 digits) There's a reason most data validation is performed outside of the database - it's very hard to set up strict rules. However, you can at least limit the ridiculousness of some of the inputs (i.e. letters for the age, or limiting the postcode to only 7 characters) You can also use ENUM to restrict the accepted values to only values that you allow, which is used for fields like Acess Level. Data security and Data control Data contains information on the user, some of which may be sensitive and requires protection. Examples of this might include: - Age - Name - Email - Sexual orientation - Religious beliefs Data security techniques Encryption Restricting employee access Authentication Keeping the database up to date Database proxy Encryption When using Encryption you should use Salts and strong, relevant encyption techniques like SHA256 over MD5 Salts are automatically generated character sets which make the passwords more secure, due to helping to hide the true password","title":"Data integrity"},{"location":"Year1/Database%20design/Data/#data-integrity","text":"Data integrity refers to the accuracy, consistency and completeness of the data.

An ALU has three parallel data buses, this consists of 2 inputs opperand (A and B) and the third which is the resulting output (A basic form of this is like a logic gate) CU The CU controls the operation of the processor. It obtains the instructions from the memory, interprets them, and directs the operation of the computer. It is responsible for controlling the transfer of data and instructions among other units of a computer It communicates with Input/Output devices for transfer of data or results from storage. It does not process or store data. Registers Registers are small amounts of high-speed memory contained within the CPU. They are used by the processor to store small amounts of data that are needed during processing, such as: The address of the next instruction to be executed The current instruction being decoded The result of calculations Some examples of Registers are P rogram C ounter ( PC ), I nstruction R egister ( IR ), M emory A ddress R egister ( MAR ), M emory D ata R egister ( MDR ) CPU speed Clock Speed A 'CPU clock cycle' is a synchronised pulse through the computer. During each cycle/pulse, billions of transistors withing the processor will open and close. Sometimes, multiple instructions can be completed each clock cycle however at the same time sometimes an instruction can take multiple clock cycles. In general, a higher clock speed means a faster CPU. The clock speed measures the number of cycles your CPU executes per second, measured in GHz Cache Cache is a small amount of R andom A ccess M emory ( RAM ) that is built directly within the processor. As it is built directly into the processor this means that it is faster to access and therefore the data/instructions can be read and used more efficiently. As there is only a small amount it is used to hold data/instructions that are more likely to be used. This allows for faster processing as the processor does not need to wait for the data/instructions to be fetched from RAM. There are different levels of cache in a CPU: Level 1: Also named primary cache Is the fastest and is embedded in the Processor chip as CPU cache Has the least amount of storage Level 2: Also names secondary cache Can be embedded in the CPU or as a co-processor or a seperate chip Has a high-speed bus connecting the cahce and CPU so it does not get slowed down by traffic on the main system Level 3: Specialised memory to improve the performance of L1 and L2 cache Usually double the speed of DRAM With multi-core processors, each core can have dedicated L1 and L2 cache, but can share L3 cache If a L3 cache references an instruction, it is usually elevated to a higher level of cache Bus in CPU A bus is a high-speed connection to all internal and external components that consists of a network of wires. Buses are used to send control signals and data between the processor and other components. There are 3 types of buses: Address Bus Carries memory addresses from the processor to other components such as primary memory and input/output devices Data Bus Carries the actual data between the processor and other components Control Bus Carries control signals from the processor to other components.

The control bus also carries the clock's pulses.","title":"Bus in CPU"},{"location":"Year1/Networking/Data%20Transmission/","text":"Data Transmission Still in progress Estimated completion date: 15.12.22 (DD.MM.YY) Factors that effect data transmission Electrical signals Conductivity aka type of wire Amount of data being sent down the wire Optical signals Uses a laser Do not use too powerful a laser as can damage Length of the cable Bends in the cable","title":"Data Transmission"},{"location":"Year1/Networking/Data%20Transmission/#data-transmission","text":"","title":"Data Transmission"},{"location":"Year1/Networking/Data%20Transmission/#still-in-progress","text":"Estimated completion date: 15.12.22 (DD.MM.YY)","title":"Still in progress"},{"location":"Year1/Networking/Data%20Transmission/#factors-that-effect-data-transmission","text":"","title":"Factors that effect data transmission"},{"location":"Year1/Networking/Data%20Transmission/#electrical-signals","text":"Conductivity aka type of wire Amount of data being sent down the wire","title":"Electrical signals"},{"location":"Year1/Networking/Data%20Transmission/#optical-signals","text":"Uses a laser Do not use too powerful a laser as can damage Length of the cable Bends in the cable","title":"Optical signals"},{"location":"Year1/Networking/Network%20Addresses/","text":"Network addresses Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) The IPv4 address is a logical network address that identifies a particular host. Must be properly configured and unique within the LAN and world Network devices (e.g.: Router, Access Point) interfaces that provide connections to an IP network will also have an IPv4 address. Does switch/hub have IP address? Every packet sent across the internet has a source and destination IPv4 address. Required by networking devices to ensure the information gets to the destination and any replies are returned to the source IPv4 addresses can be assigned either statically or dynamically Notation of IPv4 For IPv4 there are 4 groups of numbers sperated by a period (.). Each value being from 0 to 255 in binary e.g. 192.168.5.1 Static IPv4 With a static assignment, the host IPv4 address must be configured manually, together with subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server address. Static addresses are typically assigned for printers, servers, and other networking devices that need to retain a fixed IP address to provide services. Static assignment can be time consuming to implement. It is prone to errors because manual configuration is required. Dynamic IPv4 IPv4 addresses can be dynamically assigned to end devices through an application protocol know as D ynamic H ost C onfiguration P rotocol ( DHCP ) DHCP automatically assigns addressing information such as IPv4 address, subnet mask, default gateway, and other configuration information. Benefits of using DHCP: - Reduces the burden on network support staff and virtually eliminates entry errors. - A dynamic IP address is not permanently assigned to a host but is only leased for a period of time. IPv4 Structure The logical 32-bit IPv4 address is hierarchical and is made up of two parts, the network and the host. Example: IPv4 address: 192.168.5.11 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 Subnet Mask(binary): 11111111. 11111111. 11111111. 00000000 IPv4 address(binary): 11000000.10101000.00000101.00001011 Assignment of IPv4 Addresses For a company or organization to support network hosts that are accessible from the internet, such as web servers, that organization must have a block of public addresses assigned. Public IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are regulated and allocated to each organization separately. These public addresses must be unique and not repeated in their use across the world. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). - The IANA manages and allocates blocks of IP addresses to the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). - RIRs are responsible for allocating IP addresses to ISPs, who in turn provide IPv4 address blocks to organizations and smaller ISPs. - Organizations can get their addresses directly from an RIR subject to the policies of that RIR. DHCP A device can be a DHCP server if it is running the DHCP service software DHCPv4 servers are typically connected to a LAN because it uses broadcast. DHCPv4 servers deploed outside of a LAN will require relay service. In a home network or SOHO, a wireless router provides DHCP to end devices. It is also a DHCP client to get IPv4 address from ISP. DHCPv4 Operation When a host is configured using DHCP, it will try to obtain an IPv4 address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server from a DHCP. The client sends a DHCPDISCOVER message using broadcast. A DHCP server responds with a DHCPOFFER message with a set of IPv4 addressing information. The client then sends a DHCPREQUEST message to request the use of IPv4 addressing information offered by the DHCP server. The DHCP server responds with a DHCPACK message to grant the request from the client. DHCP Service Configuration To configure a home wireless router, access its graphical web interface by opening the browser and entering the router default IPv4 address: 192.168.0.1 in the IP Address field. The IPv4 address of 192.168.0.1 and subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 are the defaults for the internal router interface. This is the default gateway for all hosts on the local network. Ensure the DHCP server is enabled. Specify the DHCP IPv4 address range with a starting address (do not use 192.168.0.1 because the router is assigned this address) and the number of addresses to be assigned. Network Address Management The information that should be put into network documentation for network address management is: Device Name MAC Address IP Address DHCP Range (To specifiy which IP addresses are in the pool that new devices can connect too) Classful Addressing The first 8bits of IP address are used to define a network. This would limiting the internet to just 254 networks. Each network contained 16,777,216 different IP addresses. In 1981, Classful addressing came along to help solve that problem. With classful addresses, we went from just 254 available networks to 2,113,664 available networks. Classless addressing In 1993, as Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) introducing the concept of classless addressing. Classless addressing with variable-length subnet masking (VLSM) can allocate IP address more efficiently. Networks and Hosts Multiple logical networks can exist on one physical network, if the network portion of the logical network host addresses is different. The network portion indicates the network on which each unique host address is located. Routers only need to know how to reach each network, rather than needing to know the location of each individual host. How to Calculate Number of Hosts A subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (decimal) or 11111111.11111111.1111111.00000000 (binary) uses 24 network bits and 8 host bits. To determine how many hosts can be on that network, take the number 2 to the power of the number of host bits (2^8 = 256). Subtract 2 (256-2) for numbers that cannot be used - Broadcast address of all 1s in the host portion - Network ID of all 0s Transmission Transmission Options A unicast transmission is used for normal host-to-host communication Broadcast Transmission Broadcast packets are sent to all hosts in the network using a broadcast address. A broadcast packet contains a destination IPv4 address with all ones (1s) in the host portion. All hosts on that local network (broadcast domain) will receive and look at the packet. When a host receives a broadcast packet, the host processes the packet as it would a packet addressed to its unicast address. Multicast Transmission Multicast transmission reduces traffic by allowing a host to send a single packet to a selected set of hosts that subscribe to a multicast group. IPv4 has reserved the 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 addresses as a multicast range. The IPv4 multicast addresses 224.0.0.0 to 224.0.0.255 are reserved for multicasting on the local network only. A router connected to the local network will not forward them further. Components of a Home Network In addition to an integrated router, there are many different types of devices that might be connecting to a home network. Examples include: - Desktop computers - Gaming systems - Smart TV systems - Printers - Scanners - Security cameras - Telephones - Climate control devices Building a Home network Wireless technology enables networks to be easily expanded, without the limitations of cabled connections. One of the main advantages of wireless is the ability to provide anytime, anywhere connectivity. Wireless technology is fairly easy and inexpensive to install. New and visiting users can join the network quickly and easily. Typical Home Network Routers Small business and home routers typically have two primary types of ports: Ethernet Ports - Usually labeled \u201cEthernet\u201d or \u201cLAN\u201d, these ports connect to the internal switch portion of the router. Internet Port - Used to connect the device to another network such as the internet through a cable or DSL modem. Many home routers include a radio antenna and a built-in wireless access point. Wi-Fi Wireless standards The main organization responsible for the creation of wireless technical standards is the IEEE. The IEEE 802.11 standard governs the WLAN environment. Wireless standards for LANs use the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands. Also known as Wi-Fi. Another organization, known as the Wi-Fi Alliance, is responsible for testing wireless LAN devices from different manufacturers. Wireless standards are constantly improving the connectivity and speed of Wi-Fi networks. Wireless Settings Network mode - Determines the type of technology that must be supported. For example, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n or Mixed Mode. Network Name (SSID) - To identify the WLAN. Standard Channel - Specifies the channel over which communication will occur. By default, this is set to Auto to allow the AP to determine the optimum channel to use. SSID Broadcast - Determines if the SSID will be broadcast to all devices within range. By default, set to Enabled. Wireless Traffic Controls WiFi channels are smaller bands within WiFi frequency bands. Each channel is capable of carrying a different conversation. Multiple APs can function in close proximity as long as they use different channels for communication. Some 5 GHz wireless technologies combine multiple channels to create a single wide channel, which provides more bandwidth and increases the data rate.","title":"Network addresses"},{"location":"Year1/Networking/Network%20Addresses/#network-addresses","text":"","title":"Network addresses"},{"location":"Year1/Networking/Network%20Addresses/#internet-protocol-version-4-ipv4","text":"The IPv4 address is a logical network address that identifies a particular host.

An example of encapsulation is how a letter is put inside an envelope For communication on an IP network, the format is very specific and includes a source and destination address. Ethernet Frame On an Ethernet network, messages are put into a frame or Layer 2 protocol data units (PDUs) Jumbo frames are Ethernet frames with more than 1500 bytes of payload, the limit set by the IEEE 802.3 standard. Commonly, jumbo frames can carry up to 9000 bytes of payload. Jumbo frames can increase the efficiency of Ethernet and network processing in hosts by reducing the protocol overhead. However an issue with Jumbo frames is that the data could get interrupted easier or corrupted which means the jumbo frame might have to be resent which takes longer. Sending data For a device to communicate on a network a physical address and logical address are needed for a device to communicate on an Ethernet network. A physical address (Also named a MAC address) does not change A logical address (IP address) can changed and is commonly assigned by a network administrator. 2 parts: network and host End Device Addressing To physically connect to a network, an end-user device must have a N etwork I nterface C ard ( NIC ) Some configuration of the OS so that the device can participate in the network. There are three parts to the IP configuration which must be correct for the device to send and receive information on the network. IP address This identifies the host on a network Subnet masks This is used to identify the network on which the host is connected Default gateway This identifies the networking device Broadcast Domain A broadcast message is used to contact every device on a local network. An Ethernet broadcast is all 1s in the destination MAC address - FFFF.FFFF.FFFF A broadcast domain is the area through which a broadcast message can travel. Each local Ethernet is a broadcast domain, Routers are used to divide the network into multiple broadcast domains. Access Layer Communication In order to send information from a device that is on an Ethernet network, the device must ssupply its own source MAC address, a destination MAC address, its own source IP address, as well as a destination IP address. The A dress R esolution P rotocol ( ARP ) is used to discover the MAC address of a device on the same local network. ARP ARP uses 3 steps to discover and store the MAC address of a host on the local network when only the IPv4 address of that host is known. The sending host creates and sends a frame addressed to a broadcast MAC address. Contained in the frae is a message with the IPv4 address of the intended destination host Each host on the network recieves the broadcast frame and compares the IPv4 address contained in the message with its own IPv4 address. The host with the matching IPv4 address sends its own MAC address back to the original sending host. The sending host receives the message and stores the MAC address and the IPv4 address in an ARP table. Dividing the Local Network Broadcast Containment Routers in the distribution layer can limit broadcasts to the local network where they need to be heard. Although broadcasts are necessary, too many hosts connected on the same local network can generate excessive broadcast traffic and slow down the network. Security It also can separate and protect certain groups of computers where confidential information resides. Routers can also hide the addresses of internal computers from the outside world to help prevent attacks, and control who can get into or out of the local network. Location Routers in the distribution layer canbe used to interconnect local networks at various loxations of an organisation that are geographically seperated Logical grouping Routers in the distribution layer can be used to logically group users, such as departments within a company, who have common needs or for access to resources. Routing Routing Path Selection Each router interface connects to a different network. A routing table contains information for how to reach local and remote networks The destination IP address is used and compared with the networks in the routing table to determine the interface to forward the packet out of. Routers do not forward broadcast messages Packet forwarding The destination MAC address is used to forward the packet to either the router if the destination IP address is for a different network or a specific network device on the local network. The ARP table shows a mapping of IP address to MAC address Routing Table Entries A routing table contains network addresses and the best path to reach a network Two ways routes can be added to a routing table are: Dynamically learned from other routers Manually entered by a network Admin A default route is the router interface used when forwarding packets to a destination that is not in the routing table. If a packet is destined for a network that is not in the routing table and no default route exits, the packet will be dropped. The Default Gateway When a host sends a message to a device on the same network, it forwards the message directly and uses ARP to discover the MAC address. When a host sends a message to a device on a remote network, the hosts uses the MAC address of the router as the destination, but still has the IP address of the remote host as the Layer 3 destination. It is very important that each host has the correct default gateway that is the IP address of the router on the same network. Local and Remote Network Segments Advantages of a single local segment: Appropriate for simpler networks Less complexity and lower network cost Allows devices to be \"seen\" by other devices Faster data transfer - more direct communication Ease of device access Disadvantages of a single local segment: All hosts are in one broadcast domain which causes more traffic on the segment and may slow network performance Harder to implement QoS Harder to implement security Advantages of having hosts on a remote segment More appropriate for larger, more complex networks Splits up broadcast domains and decreases traffic Can improve performance on each segment Makes the machines invisible to those on other local network segments Can provide increased security Can improve network organization Disadvantages of having hosts on a remote segment Requires the use of routing (distribution layer) Router can slow traffic between segments More complexity and expense (requires a router) Benefits of a Hierarchical Design A hierarchical, layered design provides: Increased efficiency Optimization of function Increased speed A way in which to scale the network without impacting the performance of existing ones Three layers: Access Layer - This layer provides connections to hosts in a local Ethernet network. Distribution Layer - This layer interconnects the smaller local networks. Core Layer - This layer provides a high-speed connection between distribution layer devices. The MAC Address Table A switch builds a MAC address table by examining a frame as it comes into the switch. A switch adds the source MAC address of the device connected to the port through which the frame came in on. A switch forwards a frame out to a specific port when the destination MAC address is in the MAC address table. A switch forwards a frame out to all hosts (except the sending host) when the destination MAC address is not in the MAC address table. Standard Network Switch A standard switch receive a broadcast message from any port will send the broadcast to all other ports. Devices attached to same switch can communicate with each other. Switch stacking can provide more ports for connection (up to 300+). Virtual LAN Virtual LANS is a technology that allows you to split a network into segments using switches. A VLAN capable switch is possible to restrict broadcasts and to control which devices can communicate with each other. A Switch which supports VLANs will also include the VLAN ID (1-1005, extend up to 4094) for each entry of the MAC Address Table. Any switch port which is not explicitly assigned a VLAN number, resides in the default VLAN. Which for most vendors corresponds to VLAN 1. Traffic arriving on a switch port assigned to one VLAN will only ever be forwarded out another switch port that belongs to the same VLAN \u2013 a switch will never allow traffic to cross a VLAN boundary. Again, each VLAN operates as if it were a completely separate physical switch. Each connected switch port in the topology above is a member of only a single VLAN (an Access port). In order to extend a VLAN to the second switch, a connection is made between one Access port on both switches for each VLAN. There is a mechanism which allows a single switch port to carry traffic from multiple VLANs (a Trunk port). A tag(802.1Q) is added to the sending frames to indicate to the other end what VLAN that frame belongs to. Native trunk port What will happen if an untagged frame somehow gets into the trunk link? Without the tag, the switch will not know what VLAN the traffic belongs to, therefore the switch associates the untagged traffic with what is configured as the Native VLAN. Essentially, the Native VLAN is the VLAN that any received untagged traffic gets assigned to on a Trunk port. Native VLAN is configured per trunk port, it is locally significant and it tells the switch - \"if you receive an untagged data into this port, forward it like it is part of the native VLAN number\". By default, the native VLAN of all trunk ports on switches is assigned to VLAN 1 but it can be any valid VLAN number. The switches are not only putting the received untagged data into the native VLAN, but they are also sending the data in the Native VLAN untagged. VLAN20 is the Native VLAN of the trunk port. All control plane messages such as CDP, VTP, and DTP are also sent through the Native VLAN i.e untagged.","title":"Network components"},{"location":"Year1/Networking/Network%20components/#network-components","text":"","title":"Network components"},{"location":"Year1/Networking/Network%20components/#needs-rewriting","text":"New version due before: 08.12.22 (DD.MM.YY)","title":"Needs rewriting"},{"location":"Year1/Networking/Network%20components/#components","text":"The network infrastrucute contains three categories of hardware components: End Devices Network devices / Intermediate devices Network media","title":"Components"},{"location":"Year1/Networking/Network%20components/#encapsulation","text":"Each message is encapsulated into a specific format, called a frame, that includes the source and destination addresses.

Again, each VLAN operates as if it were a completely separate physical switch. Each connected switch port in the topology above is a member of only a single VLAN (an Access port). In order to extend a VLAN to the second switch, a connection is made between one Access port on both switches for each VLAN.

Native VLAN is configured per trunk port, it is locally significant and it tells the switch - \"if you receive an untagged data into this port, forward it like it is part of the native VLAN number\". By default, the native VLAN of all trunk ports on switches is assigned to VLAN 1 but it can be any valid VLAN number. The switches are not only putting the received untagged data into the native VLAN, but they are also sending the data in the Native VLAN untagged. VLAN20 is the Native VLAN of the trunk port.
