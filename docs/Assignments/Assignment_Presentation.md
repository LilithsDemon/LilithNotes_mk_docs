# Web Dev - Presentation

## Assignment Brief:

You are contracted as a Web Developer for Logical View Solutions LTD, a UK company specialised in providing customised web solutions for their customers.

You have been assigned a client who requires a website for their business. However, this client has limited knowledge of the web and needs some advice on the type of material (text, images, videos, animation…etc.) that can best promote their business online.

You are, therefore, required to investigate and collect the material yourself in order to present in the website, in addition to deciding the categories of the webpages and the contents of each of them in order to meet the client’s needs.

Although some stock images have been provided by the client, you are also expected to use your computing skills to develop/produce some of the material for the client, e.g. graphics, animated sliders, logos, icons, fonts as required.

Once your design and assets approved, you should start on designing the user interface for each webpage, then developing the interface and other associated functionality, e.g. storing/retrieving data to/from an online database, animated photo galleries, navigation bar…etc.

Finally, you are required to publish the completed website for the client using the company web server. It is important you ensure your site is published to the provided server.
